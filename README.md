Steps to Deploy an LLM Locally


  *Set Up a Virtual Environment:*
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies.
   - Activate the virtual environment to use it for the installation of packages and running your application.

  *Install Dependencies:*
   - Install necessary Python libraries using pip. These libraries include transformers, torch, langchain, and pypdf.
   - These libraries are required for model loading, text processing, and handling PDFs.

 *Prepare the Model and Dependencies:*
   - Ensure you have access to the pre-trained model for summarization, such as "facebook/bart-large-cnn", which can be loaded using the transformers library.
   - Confirm that you have the necessary model files and configurations to load and use the model locally.

 . *Develop the Summarization Logic:*
   - Write or integrate the code to process text from PDF files, create embeddings, and perform summarization.
   - Implement the text processing pipeline using CharacterTextSplitter, HuggingFaceEmbeddings, and FAISS for handling and querying text data.

 *Build the Application Interface:*
   - Set up a user interface using Streamlit to allow users to upload PDF documents and trigger summarization.
   - Ensure the interface handles file uploads and displays the summarized text.

  *Test the Local Deployment:*
   - Run your application locally to ensure it functions correctly. Verify that the model loads, processes documents, and generates summaries as expected.
   - Perform testing with various PDF documents to confirm the summarization quality and functionality.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy the LLM locally and integrate it with your application for document summarization.
